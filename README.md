# Influencers&News :newspaper::busts_in_silhouette:
This project has the goal to understand if news have the power to influece the top 100 Italian Instagram influecers, in terms of numbers of followers over 2022. <br>
The necessary data were collected, stored, merged and then analysed. The main data sources were:
+ Instagram
+ Google Trends 
+ [Ansa's news feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenzia_Nazionale_Stampa_Associata)

The project was divided in two parts:
1. *Data Management part*: it concernes the collection, storage and merging of the data (done in Python). The output from this phase was then used as input the Data Visualization part;
2. *Data Visualization part*: it was relative to the analysis and visualization of the data. This aspects were developed in Tableau and the final outcome can be found al this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel1868/viz/DataVisualizationProject_16733838878890/InfluencerNews?publish=yes).

Detailed descpriptions of the processes and choices made through the development can be found in the reports. <br>
